# Library of Transmogrifia 1.5.11

## Fixed

- Sidebar resize handle would stop tracking the mouse when an article was loaded because the iframe captured mouse events. Now disables `pointer-events` on the iframe during resize drag.

## Changed

- Sidebar list items now show the source hostname before recipe and relative age, matching the reader header-style metadata pattern (`origin.com · Reader · 1d ago`).

## Validation

- Full `npm run build` passes (TypeScript + Vite production build).
