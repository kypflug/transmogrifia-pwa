# Library of Transmogrifia 1.5.5

## Fixed

- Hardened iOS standalone detection for iPadOS desktop-class user agents (`MacIntel` + touch), ensuring cold-start auth recovery uses the intended iOS PWA path.
- Added clearer auth diagnostics breadcrumbs for:
  - iPadOS desktop-UA standalone detection
  - `ssoSilent` skip decisions in iOS standalone mode

## Why this release

iPadOS can present a desktop-like user agent even in installed PWA mode. This update keeps the iOS cold-start recovery path reliable on those devices and improves troubleshooting via explicit `[Auth]` logs.

## Validation

- `npm run build` passes on this release branch/workspace.
