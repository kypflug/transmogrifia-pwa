# Library of Transmogrifia 1.5.10

## Fixed

- Added a dedicated Window Controls Overlay drag strip for startup loading and startup error screens, so the installed desktop PWA window can be moved while auth recovery is in progress.

## Compatibility

- Core dependency remains `@kypflug/transmogrifier-core@^0.1.26`.

## Validation

- Full `npm run build` passes (TypeScript + Vite production build).
