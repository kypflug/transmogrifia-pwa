# Library of Transmogrifia 1.5.6

## Added

- Fast recipe (`fast-no-inference`) is now the default selection in the Add URL modal.
- Reader progress meter improvements are now part of this release:
  - Thin top progress bar in library reader and shared viewer
  - Active iframe scroll-root detection (`html` vs `body`)
  - Clean lifecycle resets when leaving article-reading states

## Changed

- Cloud queue prerequisites are now recipe-capability aware:
  - AI configuration required only for AI-dependent recipes
  - Deterministic recipes can queue without AI setup
- Cloud queue request payload now includes `aiConfig` only when required by the selected recipe.
- Core compatibility updated to `@kypflug/transmogrifier-core` `0.1.25`, including ingestion/subscription contract re-exports.

## Why this release

This release aligns PWA queue behavior with the new Fast/no-inference default and recipe capability model while keeping progress UX improvements bundled in the same patch release.

## Validation

- `npm run build` passes in the local workspace.
