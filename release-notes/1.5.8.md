# Library of Transmogrifia 1.5.8

## Fixed

- Stale deleted articles now self-heal when opened: if OneDrive returns 404/410 for article HTML, the PWA evicts the local stale entry, shows a clear "no longer available" message, and starts a background resync.
- Delta metadata race handling now treats 404/410 during metadata batch download as deletions, so sync reconciliation prunes those articles instead of leaving dead entries.
- Sync freshness semantics are stricter: `lastSyncTime` and `sync-complete` broadcast now occur only after successful reconcile, preventing failed syncs from being treated as fresh.

## Compatibility

- Core dependency remains `@kypflug/transmogrifier-core@^0.1.26`.

## Validation

- Targeted file-level TypeScript checks pass for touched files.
- Full `npm run build` currently fails due to pre-existing unrelated type errors in `src/components/article-header.ts`, `src/components/article-list.ts`, and `src/types.ts`.
